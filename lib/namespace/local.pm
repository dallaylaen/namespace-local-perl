=head1 NAME

namespace::local - Confine imports to the current scope

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module allows to use imports inside a block or sub without polluting
the whole package:

    package My::Package;

    sub using_import {
        use namespace::local;
        use Foo::Bar qw(quux);
        # quux() is available here
    }

    sub no_import {
        # quux() is unknown
    }

Unlike L<namespace::clean> by which it is clearly inspired,
it is useless at the top or your module as it will erase all
functions defined below its use line.

=head1 METHOD/FUNCTIONS

None.

=head1 CAVEATS

This module is highly experimental.
The following two conditions are guaranteed to hold
at least until leaving the beta stage:

=over

=item * All symbols available before the use line will stay so
after end of scope

=item * All I<functions> imported I<from other modules> below the use line
with names consisting of words and not present in L<perlvar>
are not going to be available after end of scope.

=back

The rest is a big grey zone.

Currently the module works by saving and then restoring globs,
so variables and filehandles are also reset.
This may be changed in the future.

Additionally, it skips C<_>, C<a>, C<b>, and all numbers,
to avoid breaking things.
More exceptions MAY be added in the future (e.g. C<ARGV>).

# this was stolen from namespace::clean
use B::Hooks::EndOfScope 'on_scope_end';

# how it works:
# 1) upon use, create a copy of caller's symbol table
# 2) upon use, restore the symbol table from backup (see comments below)
# 3) upon leaving scope, restore the table again thus erasing
#    all imports that followed the use of this module

sub import {
    my $caller = caller;

    my @names = _get_syms( $caller );

    # Shallow copy of symbol table does not work for all cases,
    #     or it would've been just '%content = %{ $caller."::" }
    my %content;
    foreach my $name( @names ) {
        $content{$name} = _save_glob( $caller, $name );
    };

    # FIXME UGLY HACK
    # Immediate backup-and-restore of symbol table
    #     somehow forces binding of symbols
    #     above 'use namespace::local' line
    #     thus preventing subsequent imports from leaking upwards
    # I do not know why it works, it shouldn't.
    _erase_syms( $caller );
    foreach my $name (@names) {
        _restore_glob( $caller, $name, $content{$name} )

# out: sorted & filtered list of symbols

# FIXME needs explanation
# We really need to filter because copying ALL table
#     was preventing on_scope_end from execution
#     (accedental reference count increase?..)
