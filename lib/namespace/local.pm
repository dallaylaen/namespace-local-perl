=head1 NAME

namespace::local - Confine imports to the current scope

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module allows to confine imports or private functions
to a given scope. The following modes of operation exist:

=head2 -around (the default)

This confines all subsequent imports and functions
between the use of L<namespace::local> and the end of scope.

    package My::Package;

    sub normal_sub {
        # frobnicate() is unknown
    }

    sub using_import {
        use namespace::local;
        use Some::Crazy::DSL qw(frobnicate);
        frobnicate Foo => 42;
    }

    sub no_import {
        # frobnicate() is unknown
    }

=head2 -below

Hides subsequent imports and functions on end of scope.

This may be used to mask private functions:

    package My::Package;
    use Moo::Role;

    # This is available everywhere
    sub public {
        return private();
    };

    use namespace::local -below;

    # This is only available in the current file
    sub private {
        return 42;
    };

Note that this doesn't work for private I<methods> since methods
are resolved at runtime.

=head2 -above

Hide all functions and exports above the use line.

This emulates L<namespace::clean>, by which this module is clearly inspired.

    package My::Module;
    use POSIX;
    use Time::HiRes;
    use Carp;
    use namespace::local -above;

    # now define public functions here

=head1 EXEMPTIONS

The following symbols are not touched by this module, to avoid breaking things:

=over

=item * anything that does not consist of word characters;

=item * $_, @_, $1, $2, ...;

=item * Arrays: C<@CARP_NOT>, C<@EXPORT>, C<@EXPORT_OK>, C<@ISA>;

=item * Scalars: C<$AUTOLOAD>, C<$a>, C<$b>;

=item * Files: C<DATA>, C<STDERR>, C<STDIN>, C<STDOUT>;

=item * Functions: C<AUTOLOAD>, C<DESTROY>, C<import>;

=back

This list is likely incomplete, and may grow in the future.

=head1 METHOD/FUNCTIONS

None.

=head1 CAVEATS

This module is highly experimental.
The following two conditions are guaranteed to hold
at least until leaving the beta stage:

=over

=item * All symbols available before the use line will stay so
after end of scope

=item * All I<functions> imported I<from other modules> below the use line
with names consisting of words and not present in L<perlvar>
are not going to be available after end of scope.

=back

The rest is a big grey zone.

Currently the module works by saving and then restoring globs,
so variables and filehandles are also reset.
This may be changed in the future.

# 1) upon use, create a copy of caller's symbol table
# 2) upon use, restore the symbol table from backup (see comments below)
